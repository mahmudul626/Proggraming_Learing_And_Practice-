üî∞ Problem Overview: Breaking the Records (Maria's Basketball Performance)
===============================================================================

Maria plays a number of basketball games each season and keeps track of her scores.
She wants to find out how many times during the season she breaks:
    ‚úÖ Her **highest score record** (if a score is higher than all previous scores)
    ‚úÖ Her **lowest score record** (if a score is lower than all previous scores)

üîπ The first game sets both the initial highest and lowest records.
üîπ Then, for each following game:
     üî∏ If score > current_max ‚ûù increase max record break count
     üî∏ If score < current_min ‚ûù increase min record break count

üì• Input:
    ‚ñ∏ Integer n: number of games played
    ‚ñ∏ Integer array scores[n]: scores in each game (in the order played)

üì§ Output:
    ‚ñ∏ Two integers:
        ‚û§ Number of times the max score record was broken
        ‚û§ Number of times the min score record was broken

üß† Example:
    Input:
        9
        10 5 20 20 4 5 2 25 1
    Output:
        2 4

    Explanation:
        ‚ñ∏ Maria broke her max record 2 times: (20 and 25)
        ‚ñ∏ She broke her min record 4 times: (5, 4, 2, 1)

üéØ Key Concepts Practiced:
    - Array traversal
    - Conditional logic
    - Counters for tracking changes
